						<h1> Message to a friend: </h1>
						
`						<p> I've never had an older brother - I'm the oldest among four siblings, and I don't really have anyone that I look up to,	
							or anyone that I can openly tease and have fun with, regardless of topic and responsibilty. While not being my exact idea
							of an older brother, O'Neil was always a person I could talk to about games and someone I could <i> actually </i> play those
							games with.<br><br>
							
							He's someone I could call out to and hug in between classes, a sort of support system and love that exists in the same wavelength
							as that of the other friends mentioned here - but still unique, a bond I share with no other friend than he. <br><br>
							
							He owns a spirit that doesn't bend to stress and hardship - he always strives to be better, and to be stronger, and I have
							always admired him for that. I envy him for his strength and spirit, because it is something that I wish I could've had so long
							ago. At the same time, though, this spirit is <i> so </i> infectious, that it has even been able to touch my heart, bringing me
							laughter and a reason to smile.
